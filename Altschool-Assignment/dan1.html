  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>My name is Fadipe Monioluwa Daniel</p>

  <p>I am a 20 year old Nigerian obsessed with learning random stuffs. I'm a fan of history and philosophy - two topics
    most people find rather boring, so most people tend to see me as boring, but I know I'm as cool as the word itself.
